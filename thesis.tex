%This version of the thesis template has been updated for the February 2017 thesis guidelines provided by the School of Graduate and Advanced Studies by David Freund and Daryl DeFord.

%  Some good options are draft and singlespacing, for drafts, and *final*,
%for the final cut, and noheadings, for a printout without headings.  
%You can also use the copyright option to add a copyright.  Note:
%final will enforce a bunch of different options, like oneside, 12pt
%and doublespacing, as well as make the margins correct.   Draft, has
%larger margins and is appropriate for twosided printing.

%%%%    IMPORTANT     %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  Because dvips doesn't know/care about the page size of the dvi file
%  its working on, and because its so important that the margins of
%  your thesis are correct you have to make sure that you are using
%  the command dvi -t letter *thesisnamehere*
%
%  If you are using a terminal this is straightforward, but if you are
%  using a tex editing program it make take a little bit of searching
%  before you figure out how to make this work. 
%  
%  Alternatively, you might consider compiling using pdflatex, which
%  compiles straight to a PDF and doesn't have this problem.
